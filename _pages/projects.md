# Research Projects

- **Intracellular Signaling in Heterogeneous Media (PhD, Inria Aistrosight)**  
  Developed physics-informed machine learning tools to analyze spatial heterogeneity in transcription factor diffusion, using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and single-particle tracking (SPT).

- **Multiscale Photonic Simulation for TF Dynamics (Internship, Inria Beagle)**  
  Designed a multimodal simulator combining FCS and SPT to analyze the spatiotemporal behavior of transcription factors in the nucleus.

- **Bone Regeneration Modeling (Internship, Universit√© Lyon 1)**  
  Created a numerical model combining integro-differential and ODE systems to describe bone regeneration mechanisms.
