Welcome to my academic website!

I am a postdoctoral researcher in applied mathematics and computational biology. In December 2024, I defended my Ph.D. at Universit√© Lyon 1, under the supervision of *[Hugues Berry](https://hberry.gitlabpages.inria.fr/mywebpage/)*, within the AIstroSight team at Inria Lyon. My work focused on modelling intracellular signaling in spatially heterogeneous media.

Starting in summer 2025, I will join the *[Ricci Lab](https://www.ricci-lab.com)* at Institut Imagine in Paris for a postdoctoral position, where I will explore gene regulatory networks.

## Research Interests

I use mathematical and computational models to explore intracellular dynamics. My work focuses on biochemical reaction networks and how cellular signaling is shaped by spatial constraints (molecular crowding, compartmentalization, ...). I am particularly interested in situations involving anomalous or biased transport, which challenge classical diffusion assumptions. I also investigate the regulation of these systems using approaches based on control theory and inverse problems. These questions are adressed using a range of modeling strategies, from mechanistic to data-driven methods.

## About

Beyond research, I actively contribute to the scientific community and help organize events for early-career researchers with the *[Imabio Young Scientist network](https://sites.google.com/view/iysn/home)*
