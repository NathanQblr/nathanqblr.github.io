# Nathan Quiblier

Welcome to my academic website. I am a postdoctoral researcher in mathematical modeling applied to biology. My research focuses on the spatiotemporal dynamics of biological systems through simulations, learning algorithms, and stochastic methods.

## Research Interests

- **Mathematical Modeling**: PDEs, ODEs, stochastic processes  
- **Computational Modeling**: reaction networks, spatial models, molecular trajectories  
- **Numerical Simulation**: finite volume, finite element methods, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)  
- **AI for Biomedical Data**: deep learning, Bayesian approaches

## About

I am particularly interested in the interface between mathematics, artificial intelligence, and biology. Beyond research, I actively contribute to the scientific community and help organize events for early-career researchers.
