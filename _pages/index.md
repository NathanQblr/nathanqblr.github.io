I am a postdoctoral researcher in applied mathematics and computational biology at Institut Imagine in Paris, where I work in the *[Ricci Lab](https://www.ricci-lab.com)* since July 2025. My research focuses on single-cell transcriptomics analysis, gene regulatory network inference, and the optimization and control of biological systems using machine learning and mathematical modeling.

In December 2024, I defended my Ph.D. at Université Lyon 1 under the supervision of *[Hugues Berry](https://hberry.gitlabpages.inria.fr/mywebpage/)*, within the AIstroSight team at Inria Lyon. My doctoral work focused on modeling intracellular signaling in spatially heterogeneous media, combining mechanistic approaches with statistical learning methods.

## Research Interests

My research bridges mathematical modeling, machine learning, and biological discovery. I develop computational frameworks to understand cellular dynamics across multiple scales—from single-molecule trajectories to gene regulatory networks and cell fate decisions. 

Current research directions include:
- **Single-cell transcriptomics**:  Developing end-to-end analysis pipelines for scRNA-seq data, including trajectory inference, cell fate prediction, and regulatory network reconstruction
- **Dynamical systems & optimization**: Learning biological dynamics from omics data to perform optimization and control of cellular processes
- **Physics-informed machine learning**: Integrating mechanistic models with deep learning to yield robust, interpretable predictions for therapeutic applications
- **Spatial and temporal heterogeneity**: Modeling how compartmentalization, molecular crowding, and anomalous transport shape cellular signaling

I combine diverse mathematical approaches (ODEs, SDEs, PDEs, optimal transport, stochastic processes) with modern ML tools (PyTorch, TensorFlow) to tackle inverse problems, control theory, and system identification in biological contexts.

## About

Beyond research, I actively contribute to the scientific community by organizing events for early-career researchers with the *[Imabio Young Scientist Network](https://sites.google.com/view/iysn/home)*. I am passionate about translating computational advances into impactful biomedical applications and building bridges between mathematics, computer science, and biology.

I develop open-source tools to make advanced methods accessible to experimental biologists, including *[SPTools](https://github.com/nquiblier/SPTools)* and *[MLFCS](https://github.com/nquiblier/MLFCS)*.
