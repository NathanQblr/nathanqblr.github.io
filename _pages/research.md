- **Modelling endosome induced compartmentalization in signalization**
  Developed a coagulation based pde to model signaling pathway, taking into account endosomes' life cycle. Then developed a finite volume scheme to challenge biological data

- **Inference of physical parameters of anomalous transport**  
  Developed physics-informed machine learning tools to analyze spatial heterogeneity in transcription factor diffusion, using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and single-particle tracking (SPT). Particularly studying anomalous behaviour.

- **Multiscale Photonic Simulation for TF Dynamics**  
  Designed a multimodal simulator combining FCS and SPT to analyze the spatiotemporal behavior of transcription factors in the nucleus.
